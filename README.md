# PathHighlightOverlay

Network Highlight Overlay

Network Highlight Overlay is a Cities: Skylines mod that highlights selected network types (roads, rails, pedestrian paths, transit infrastructure, bridges, tunnels, etc.) with customizable colors. 
It is useful for debugging, visual clarity, screenshots, and inspecting hidden / underground / service networks. During my testing, it worked for insivible (workshop) paths, too.

This mod depends on Harmony 2 and Unified UI (UUI).
